# Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my Personal Portfolio page.

This showcases my work and my knowledge from the past couple months of learning web development. 

This project was a great opportunity for me, as it allowed me to showcase the skills I have learned from the previous months, as well as learn new skills, and was a great process in learning the process of finding new packages on my own.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React
- Styled Components 
- Git/GitHub for version control

## Portfolio Sections
### Navigation Bar

Here we have the navigation bar for the page, when pressing any of the options on the right side, it will bring you to the section.

When the resolution of the monitor / device is below 1024px in width, the menu options will disappear and a burger menu will appear instead that when clicked will spawn a menu to move around between.

# Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my Personal Portfolio page.

This showcases my work and my knowledge from the past couple months of learning web development. 

This project was a great opportunity for me, as it allowed me to showcase the skills I have learned from the previous months, as well as learn new skills, and was a great process in learning the process of finding new packages on my own.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React
- Styled Components 
- Git/GitHub for version control
